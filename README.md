## 🚀 About the Project

**KodeX** is a robust, full-stack web application designed to democratize programming by providing a seamless, interactive environment for writing, executing, and evaluating code. 

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and deeply integrated with the **Judge0** execution engine, KodeX offers enterprise-grade code isolation, real-time feedback, and comprehensive analytics. Whether you are a coding enthusiast practicing algorithms, a learner taking their first steps, or an educator designing assessments, KodeX is built to scale and perform.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

KodeX is designed with a decoupled architecture, ensuring scalability, security, and performance.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Integrated Code Editor**: A feature-rich, deeply customizable in-browser code editor powered by Monaco Editor (the same core engine that powers VS Code). Features syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and multi-language support.
*   **Secure Code Execution Sandbox**: Utilizes **Judge0** natively for isolated, secure, and highly reliable code compilation and execution across dozens of programming languages.
*   **Advanced Authentication**: Enterprise-grade security featuring JWT-based authentication coupled with Firebase integration for robust identity management.
*   **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**: Beautiful, data-rich visual representations of user progress, submission histories, and accuracy metrics powered by Recharts.
*   **Real-time Leaderboard**: A dynamic, highly-optimized ranking system allowing users to measure their performance against peers globally based on sophisticated scoring algorithms.
*   **Modern Workspace**: A fluid, responsive user interface engineered with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS 4, offering deep dark mode integration and seamless user-flows.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:
*   **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
*   **MongoDB**: Local instance running, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string
*   **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required for running the local Judge0 execution environment
*   **Git**: For version control

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jeet0105/KodeX.git
    cd KodeX
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Backend**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Initialize the Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Spin up the infrastructure (Judge0)**
    Navigate to the infrastructure directory and start the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    cd ../infrastructure/judge0
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Environment Variables

You must create `.env` files in both the client and server directories.

**Backend (`server/.env`)**
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JUDGE0_URL=http://localhost:2358 # Default local Judge0 instance
```

**Frontend (`client/.env`)**
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, you'll need to start both the client and server development servers.

**Terminal 1 (Backend)**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend)**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port Vite assigns) and the server will listen on `localhost:5000`.
